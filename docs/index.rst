MTKruto Python
==============

Welcome to the API reference of the official Python library for MTKruto Server!

As you may have already noticed, all methods and fields of the API are in snake_case in this library.
We did this for convenience and to make it consistent with your existing Python code.

The package consists of four submodules:

1. ``mtkruto`` (includes the ``Client`` class)
2. ``mtkruto.types`` (MTKruto types),
3. ``mtkruto.filters`` (update filters)
4. ``mtkruto.errors`` (MTKruto errors).
